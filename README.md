# DeadBeatSimulator

> *Simulate a deadbeat dad on demand!*

You are a deadbeat dad. Your wife is unhappy and wants a divorce, so you decide to go to a bar. As you drive home from the bar, you get pulled over by the cops to take a breathalyzer test. Since your blood alcohol concentration is way too high, you speed away from the cops to avoid getting arrested, so the cops start chasing you just **3 minutes** away from your home.

**Your Goal**: Avoid the cops long enough to get home!

## How to Play

There are two options to use for the controller:

1. Wii remote + breathalyzer *(recommended)*

2. Keyboard + mouse
